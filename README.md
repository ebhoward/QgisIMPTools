# IMP Tools
IMP Tools are available for download here as QGIS Processing Toolbox scripts for supporting industrial park layout design work.


### Pre-requisites
You need to be familiar with using QGIS.
You need to have QGIS 3.16 installed.  
<!-- Additionally, install the Qgis2threejs plugin -->

### Installation
1. In Github, click on the green Code button and then Download ZIP.  Unzip after downloading.

2. Copy *all the files only* in the unzipped scripts folder to the QGIS Processing Scripts folder.  You can check the location of the QGIS Scripts folder as follows:

    QGIS >Setings >Options >Processing >Scripts

    If the folder does not exist, create it by typing in your desired folder.

3. Copy the samples folder and its qsettings folder to a working folder.  You can open the Tutorial.qgz project in QGIS.  

4. Alternatively, you may prefer to create and save a new QGIS Project.  In this case, copy the qsettings folder and all its files into the folder which has your newly created qgz QGIS project file.  


    - Set the project CRS:
    QGIS >Project >Properties >CRS>


    - Optional: click on the + button at the bottom right and add a new variable project_font_size.  Type in your desired size - for example, 8, or 14 et cetera.  


### Using the IMP Tools
1. The IMP Tools are available from:
    QGIS > Processing >Toolbox >Scripts
    
2. Simple documentation is available by clicking the Wiki button in Github.
        
### Contribution
If you are familiar with Python programming in QGIS, you are welcome to modify the scripts.  Or the documentation in the Github wiki.
