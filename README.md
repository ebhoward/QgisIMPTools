### Installation
1. In Github, click on the green Code button and then Download ZIP.  Unzip after downloading.

3. Set the project CRS:
    QGIS >Project >Properties >CRS>

4. Optional: click on the + button at the bottom right and add a new variable project_font_size.  Type in your desired size - for example, 8, or 14 et cetera.  

5. Copy all the files in the unzipped samples folder into your newly created QGIS project folder.  Drag and drop the files into QGIS.
