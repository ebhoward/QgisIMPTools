# IMP Tools
IMP Tools are available for download here as QGIS Processing Toolbox scripts for supporting industrial park layout design work.


### Pre-requisites
You need to be familiar with using QGIS.
You need to have QGIS 3.16 installed.  
<!-- Additionally, install the Qgis2threejs plugin -->

### Installation
1. In Github, click on the green Code button and then Download ZIP.  Unzip (extract the files) after downloading.

2. In the samples folder, double-click Tutorial to start QGIS.

3. Check the location of your QGIS Processing Scripts folder as follows:

        QGIS >Setings >Options >Processing >Scripts

    If the folder does not exist, create it by typing in your desired folder.

4. Copy *all the files only* in the unzipped **scripts** folder to the QGIS Processing Scripts folder.  

5. If you wish to use the IMP Tools on your own data instead of the sample data with Tutorial.qgz, do the following:

    - Set the project CRS for your QGIS project:
    
        QGIS >Project >Properties >CRS>

    - Optional: click on the + button at the bottom right and add a new variable project_font_size.  Type in your desired size - for example, 8, or 14 et cetera.  


### Using the IMP Tools
1. The IMP Tools are now available from the QGIS Processing Toolbox panel:

        QGIS > Processing >Toolbox >Scripts
    
2. Simple documentation is available by clicking the Wiki button in Github.
        
### Contribution
If you are familiar with Python programming in QGIS, you are welcome to modify the scripts.  Or the documentation in the Github wiki.
